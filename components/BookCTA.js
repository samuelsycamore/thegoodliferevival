      <em>Foraging North America: The Botany, Taxonomy and Ecology of Edible Wild Plants</em>.

    <p>
      <em>Foraging North America</em> is a 12-week crash course designed to arm you with a functional working knowledge of botany and taxonomy that you can take with you out onto the land to fast-track the ID process and boost your confidence when gathering wild foods for the first (or five-hundredth!) time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll get a practical education in ecological literacy by applying the ethos of <strong>conservation through use</strong>—the (surprisingly) radical notion that humans can, in fact, have a positive impact on the environments that we move through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food is everywhere—you just need to know what to look for!
    </p>
    <p>Check out <em>Foraging North America</em> to get started today.</p>
