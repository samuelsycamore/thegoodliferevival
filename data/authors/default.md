I'm Sam Sycamore, a writer and radical ecologist from Kentucky, now residing in Minnesota I'm passionate about learning how to better align my lifestyle with the landscapes that I walk upon.

**What is "The Good Life"?**

"The good life" means something a little different to everybody, but I love discussing this topic with other people because everyone has their own definition, and I derive great joy and inspiration from hearing the stories of others who've also chosen this path back to nature.

Here's how I like to define the good life, in the simplest terms: 

- our days are self-directed, 

- our meals are self-produced, 

- our communities are self-sustaining, and 

- our landscapes are self-regenerating. 

A lofty goal indeed, but I know for a fact that it's achievable!
